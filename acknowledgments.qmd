I would like to thank the many people who made this book possible. In particular, the early readers who gave me valuable advice: Fredi, Eliot , Srishti, my father, and many others. 

A special mention goes to my lovely girlfriend for telling me that one of the early drafts was badly written (for the record, she was right). And of course, for sharing the ups and downs of this writing journey with me.

I also want to thank the online Machine Learning community who encouraged me to make this book available in print.

Thank you reader, for making this project possible. I hope that you enjoyed engaging with the ideas in this book.
